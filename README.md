# Database-Connector
This project requires Python and MySQL server to be installed.

This code is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing databases and all its related tasks, even for users without any prior knowledge of database management.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) server if you haven't already.
3. Open `ConnectVals.py` file and update the database connection values as necessary.
4. Run `main.py` to start the program.

## Usage

Once you have run `main.py`, follow the instructions displayed on the console to use the program...

## Future Plans

Expanding the project to support multiple databases through the use of an ORM would provide users with a consistent API for connecting to and manipulating databases, regardless of the underlying system. This would increase the versatility and usefulness of your project, and make it accessible to a wider audience.
